A Timeline about the Leaning Tower of Pisa:
On January 5, 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a widow and resident of the house of dell'Opera di Santa maria, bequeathed sixty soldi to the 
Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte marie. The sum was then used toward the purchase of a few stones which still form the base of the bell tower.
On August 9, 1173, the foundations of the tower were laid.
Nearly four centuries later Giorgio Vasari wrote: "Guglielmo, according to what is being said, in [this] year 1174 with Bonanno as sculptor, laid the foundations of the bell tower of the cathedral in Pisa."
On December 27, 1233, the worker Benenato, son of Gerardo Bottici, oversaw the continuation of the construction of the bell tower.[14]
On February 23, 1260, Guido Speziale, son of Giovanni, a worker on the cathedral Santa Maria Maggiore, was elected to oversee the building of the tower.[15]
On April 12, 1264, the master builder Giovanni di Simone and 23 workers went to the mountains close to Pisa to cut marble. The cut stones were given to Rainaldo Speziale, worker of St. Francesco.[16]
Giorgio Vasari indicated that Tommaso di Andrea Pisano was the designer of the belfry[17] between 1360 and 1370.

Information about Facebook:
On September 26, 2006, Facebook was opened to everyone at least 13 years old with a valid email address.[30][31][32] In late 2007, Facebook had 100,000 business pages (pages which allowed companies to promote themselves and attract customers). These started as group pages, but a new concept called company pages was planned.[33] Pages began rolling out for businesses in May 2009.[34] On October 24, 2007, Microsoft announced that it had purchased a 1.6% share of Facebook for $240 million, giving Facebook a total implied value of around $15 billion. Microsoft's purchase included rights to place international advertisements on the social networking site.[35][36]

In October 2008, Facebook announced that it would set up its international headquarters in Dublin, Ireland.[37] Almost a year later, in September 2009, Facebook said that it had turned cash-flow positive for the first time.[38] A January 2009 Compete.com study ranked Facebook the most used social networking service by worldwide monthly active users.[39] Entertainment Weekly included the site on its end-of-the-decade "best-of" list saying, "How on earth did we stalk our exes, remember our co-workers' birthdays, bug our friends, and play a rousing game of Scrabulous before Facebook?"[40]

Obama:
Obama was born on August 4, 1961,[2] at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, Hawaii.[3][4][5] He is the only President who was born in Hawaii[6] and the only President who was born outside of the contiguous 48 states.[7] He was born to a white mother and a black father. His mother, Ann Dunham, was born in Wichita, Kansas; she was mostly of English descent,[8] with some German, Irish, Scottish, Swiss, and Welsh ancestry.[9] His father, Barack Obama Sr., was a married Luo Kenyan man from Nyang'oma Kogelo. Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was a foreign student on scholarship.[10][11] The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.[12][13]

In late August 1961 (only a few weeks after he was born), Barack and his mother moved to the University of Washington in Seattle, where they lived for a year. During that time, the elder Obama completed his undergraduate degree in economics in Hawaii, graduating in June 1962. He then left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at Harvard University, where he earned an M.A. in economics. Obama's parents divorced in March 1964.[14] Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time. He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas time in 1971,[15] before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old.[16] Recalling his early childhood, Obama said, "That my father looked nothing like the people around me – that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk – barely registered in my mind."[11] He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.[17]

In 1963, Dunham met Lolo Soetoro at the University of Hawaii; he was an Indonesian East–West Center graduate student in geography. The couple married on Molokai on March 15, 1965.[18] After two one-year extensions of his J-1 visa, Lolo returned to Indonesia in 1966. His wife and stepson followed sixteen months later in 1967. The family initially lived in a Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the Tebet subdistrict of south Jakarta. From 1970, they lived in a wealthier neighborhood in the Menteng subdistrict of central Jakarta.[19]

Traffic to Facebook increased steadily after 2009. The company announced 500 million users in July 2010,[41] and according to its data, half of the site's membership used Facebook daily, for an average of 34 minutes, while 150 million users accessed the site by mobile. A company representative called the milestone a "quiet revolution."[42] In November 2010, based on SecondMarket Inc. (an exchange for privately held companies' shares), Facebook's value was $41 billion. The company had slightly surpassed eBay to become the third largest American web company after Google and Amazon.com.[43][44]
